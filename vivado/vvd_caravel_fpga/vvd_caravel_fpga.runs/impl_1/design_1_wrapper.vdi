WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/soc/core/clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/soc/core/RAM_reg_0_i_1/O, cell design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/soc/core/RAM_reg_0_i_1.

WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/soc/core/VexRiscv/RegFilePlugin_regFile_reg_2 has an input control pin design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/soc/core/VexRiscv/RegFilePlugin_regFile_reg_2/ADDRARDADDR[7] (net: design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/soc/core/VexRiscv/decode_RegFilePlugin_regFileReadAddress2[2]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/mprj/uart/ctrl/o_wb_ack_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
